# Java Concurrency and Multithreading in Practice
This is the code repository for [Java Concurrency and Multithreading in Practice]( https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/java-concurrency-and-multithreading-practice-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Multi-core processors are everywhereâ€”from super-computers to mobile devices right in your pocket. That's why a modern developer must know how to leverage the power of multithreading.
This course will teach you how to use parallelism and concurrency in Java. You will learn how to parallelize tasks and functions with the ForkJoin framework and Streams. You will also learn how to work with the very popular Reactive Streams recently introduced to Java. Furthermore, you will master concurrent collections and lower-level synchronization techniques with locks. 

This course conveniently provides quizzes to evaluate your knowledge and help you retain the new concepts. 

By the end of this practical training course, you will have the knowledge to write elegant programs for multicore computers with enhanced performance and improved responsiveness.
